### Hi there I am PranavðŸ‘‹
a passionate computer science enthusiast currently pursuing my M.S. in Computer Science with a concentration in Systems Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology. My interests lie in Deep Learning and Systems Engineering.

I completed my undergraduate studies in Data Science at the University of California, Berkeley, where I fell in love with the idea of sharpening and growing my mind every day, little by little.

I'm always eager to meet new people who share a passion for computer science. Feel free to reach outâ€”I'd love to chat!
